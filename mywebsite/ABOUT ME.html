 <p>THE BEGINNING </p>
 

 
 <p style="line-height: 3;">I have always been drawn to beauty and aesthetics. My birth took place on June 29, 2003, in Subang Jaya. Within my family life, there are two sides, and I have five brothers. I happen to be the only girl and the youngest among them, which makes it quite an interesting dynamic!.° ༘🎧⋆🖇₊˚ෆ</p>

 Presently, I'm pursuing my diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara Campus Rembau. Initially, I wasn't entirely certain about this course as it wasn't exactly aligned with my interests and preferred field. However, as I approach my final year, I've come to realize that there might be a reason why I was destined for this course.

Throughout this journey, I've encountered wonderful people such as my roommates and classmates who have made this diploma experience incredibly enjoyable. Sadly, this camaraderie is about to change as we all have decided to pursue our degrees in different directions. Personally, I'm considering continuing my studies at a university in the UK, which means a physical distance from these friends who've become an integral part of my life during this diploma journey. 
 
 As a student nearing the completion of my diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara Campus Rembau, I have found myself reflecting on the numerous aspects of university life and education.˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆ </p>

	 During my diploma journey, I have had the pleasure of meeting such wonderful people. Their real kindness, unwavering support, and support have been like pillars that have helped me get through the tough parts of this diploma journey. Getting to know these people and becoming friends with them is not only an interesting part of my academic life, but also a treasure that has made this journey much more important and fun.

     Thanks for the people I have met during this time doesn't seem like enough when I think about how much they have affected me. Their being there has been a source of strength, giving me comfort and drive when things got tough. The support they gave me was very important in helping me finish this diploma. What could have been a lonely road became one with shared successes and fond memories.


     Creating these memories with people I respect has been more than just a side effect of my education it has been the main thing that has made my education better. These shared experiences, laughs, and help have not only helped me do better in university, but they have also helped me grow as a person and given me a deep understanding of how important it is to work together and have real bonds in university and in life. I am truly going to miss them so much :( ❤️
