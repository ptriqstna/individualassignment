 <p style="line-height: 3;"> 
	From Standard 1 to Standard 6, I went to Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Kelana in Kelana Jaya for my primary school schooling. It was there that I took my UPSR test in Standard 6 and got 3As and 2Bs.(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )
<br>
    As I moved on to secondary school, I moved to Subang Jaya and started going to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan USJ 4. My PT3 and SPM exams were part of this trip, which went from Form 1 to Form 5. I did better than I thought I would in PT3, but when I moved on to Form 4, things got harder, especially in Accounts, Economics, and Add Maths for my SPM. But I finally got over the problems by sticking with it, especially when it came to doing well in Add Maths.‚ù§üò≠

<br>
    When I was done with SPM, I applied to UPU to continue my education and was accepted to Universiti Teknologi Mara Campus Rembau to study Information Management. Presently, I find myself in the bittersweet final semester of my diploma.
<br>
    Looking ahead, my aspirations drive me towards the next chapter of my educational journey. I plan to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Business Computing for three years at Brunel University London in the United Kingdom. This step signifies a new beginning, carrying with it a blend of excitement and a touch of melancholy as I bid farewell to my diploma and embark on this promising adventure.‚ù§Ô∏èüíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è
